If building leveldb fails in the last line of your build just use the ones included in the leveldb folders for your platform (win32 if cross platform linux)


STEPS TAKING IN SCRIPT:
Troubleshooting

In the event you encounter problems compiling the daemon, feel free to consult the guide below:

Receive the following error?

PROBLEM:

g++: error: /home/user/Desktop/onyx/OnyxCoin/src/leveldb/libleveldb.a: No such file or directory g++: error: /home/user/Desktop/onyx/OnyxCoin/src/leveldb/libmemenv.a: No such file or directory

SOLUTION:

cd src/leveldb make libleveldb.a libmemenv.a

CD back to src and try to build it again.

If you get the following error trying to do the above,

/bin/sh: 1: ./build_detect_platform: Permission denied Makefile:18: build_config.mk: No such file or directory

chmod 755 src/leveldb/build_detect_platform

and try it again.
